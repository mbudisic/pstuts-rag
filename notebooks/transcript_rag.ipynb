So, it's important to understand, what layers are and why to use them - which we'll cover in this video. If you're following along, open this layered image from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial. You might think of layers like separate flat pints of glass, stacked one on top of the other. Each layer contains separate pieces of content. To get a sense of how layers are constructed, let's take a look at this Layers panel. I've closed my other panels, so that we can focus on the Layers panel. But you can skip that. By the way: If your Layers panel isn't showing, go up to the Window menu and choose Layers from there. The Layers panel is where you go to select and work with layers. In this image there are 4 layers, each with separate content. If you click the Eye icon to the left of a layer, you can toggle the visibility of that layer off and on. So, I'm going to turn off the visibility of the tailor layer. And keep your eye on the image, so you can see what's on that layer.\"),\n",

A quick way to turn off all the layers except the tailor layer, is to hold down the Option key on the Mac, or the ALT key on the PC, and click on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer. In the Document window, you can see that this layer contains just the one small photo surrounded by a gray and white checkerboard pattern. That pattern represents transparent pixels, which allow us to see down through the corresponding part of this layer to the content of the layers below. So, let's turn that content back on by going back to the Layers panel, again holding the Option key on the Mac or the ALT key on the PC and clicking on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer. And all the other layers and their Eye icons come back into view. So again: You might think of layers like a stack of pints of glass, each with its own artwork and in some cases transparent areas that let you see down through to the layers below. The biggest benefit of having items on separate layers like this, is that you'll be able to edit pieces of an image independently without affecting the rest of the image.\")],\n",
