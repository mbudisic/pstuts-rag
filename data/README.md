PsTuts-VQA is a video question answering dataset on the narrated instructional videos for an image editing software. All the videos and their manual transcripts in English were obtained from the official website of the software. To collect a high-quality question answering dataset, three image editing experts using the software were hired and asked to watch the videos in sequence and generate a question and answer pair at a moment in the video. Each answer is linked to an entity or an option in an existing knowledge base for the software. The dataset includes the following resources: 76 videos (5.6 hours in total), 17,768 question-answer pairs, and a domain knowledge-base with 1,236 entities and 2,196 options.
