        "page_content": "At any time when you're working in Adobe Photoshop on a complicated subject the possibility exists of chaos ensuing.\nWell, you know what chaos there is, don't you?\nIt's my studio in the middle of a project.\nWhat I would like to do is reduce the clutter, reduce the chaos.\nLet me move Layers over here again, I would say that is not really necessary, but it makes life easier.\nI have an Andy's Funny Face character.\nEach one of the pieces of the face are in separate layers.\nNothing wrong with that.\nIt doesn't really hurt a thing, gives me total control.\nBut I would like to reduce the clutter in my Layers panel by creating something called a Group.\nSo let's do this a couple of ways.\nNumber one, we can come down here and click this button right there.\nThat's a \"Group\" button.\nGo and click it.\nIt will give you a group called: Group 1.\nNow, there is nothing in it yet, it's just there.\nTo get these elements in here is actually pretty easy.\nSelect this one and \"Shift\" click down here - assuming you want them all.\nNow actually maybe you don't.\nLet me show you something else here.\nIf you click on this one and hold down the \"Command\" key on a Macintosh or the \"Control\" key in Windows you can select, well, every other one if you want to.\nIf you want to select them all - \"Shift\" click.\nNow I'll just drag them up to Group 1 Until you see a little box kind of come around Group 1 and let go.\nThey should indent if it worked.\nAnd then we can close it off.\nI'm a big namer of stuff.\nSo if we get into Group 1 and select it and type in: \"Face elements\" or something like that I suppose that would be good.\nThere is a lot of advantage if you will, to doing what we just did.\nNumber one: all the elements are in one area, it reduces the chaos or clutter inside your Layers panel.\nIf we have the \"Move\" tool selected, which we do, we can move all of them at the same time.\nWe can use our Locking mechanisms all at the same time, we can use our Opacity all at the same time, and we can Show/Hide all at the same time.\nIf at any time we want to work on these individually, we can open it up and there you go.\nNow let's say, over the course of time that you decide, that you don't want to have these inside of a group.\nYou could actually drag them out.\nLet me show you an easy way to do this.\nSelect the group \"Face elements\".\nNow I actually go down and click this button, which is for deleting.\nIt's going to ask you: Do you want to delete the Group and the Contents or just the Group? - Quickest way to do it.\nClick \"Group Only\" and they come right back out for you and now they are individual.\nAnother way to make a group, that's actually a little bit easier, is let's go ahead and select them all again.\nThis time go into your options for \"Layers\" - this button right here and select \"New Group from Layers\".\nThe cool thing is, it takes you right here and allows you to give it a name.\nClick \"OK\".\nYou did it again.\nLet's talk about one more way to do this.\nUsing searching.\nLet's say we have a complicated document that has a lot of stuff in it.\nWe have a lot of type or text layers.\nThat's a unique type of layer in the Layers panel, which got a bunch of them you've got a couple of hundred layers and these are scattered all over the place.\nAnd you want all of your type layers in one group.\nSo we go to the Search facility here and click \"Kind\".\nAnd then click this button for just type layers.\nIt isolates everything but those two.\nWe select them with a \"Shift\" click, go up here, this is the easiest way to do it.\nGo into \"New Group from Layers\" and call it \"Text\" - type whatever you want.\nAnd then turn this back off again - here.\nAnd there you go.\nCreating groups gives you control, it reduces the chaos and clutter in the Layers panel and if at any time you change your mind, it's a very easy thing to take them back out again.",

        "summary": "In Adobe Photoshop, working on complex projects can create chaos in the Layers panel, which can be managed by grouping layers. Groups help reduce clutter by organizing multiple layers into a single folder, allowing easier control over moving, locking, opacity, and visibility. Layers can be added to groups by selecting them and dragging into the group or by using the \"New Group from Layers\" option, which also allows naming the group. Users can select layers individually or in bulk using Shift or Command/Control keys. Groups can be collapsed to save space and expanded to edit individual layers. If needed, layers can be removed from groups by deleting the group but keeping the contents. The Search feature helps isolate specific types of layers, like text layers, to group them efficiently. Overall, grouping layers enhances workflow by organizing elements and simplifying layer management.",

        "page_content": "In this video, you'll learn what vector artwork is, create a custom shape in Photoshop, and add a vector logo made in Illustrator to your Photoshop design.\nVector graphics are made up of lines and curves.\nYou can freely move or scale vector graphics without loosing detail or clarity.\nThat's why vector is a great choice for a logo or a graphic.\nLet's start by creating a vector shape in Photoshop.\nClick and hold down in the rectangle tool in the Tools panel.\nSelect the custom shape tool from the menu.\nIn the Options bar, click the arrow in the Shape option to view the shape picker so we can see default shapes.\nThere's nothing I want to use here, so I'll click the gear icon on the right of the shape picker and choose the Shapes category.\nThen I'll click OK.\nSelect the five point star shape and click in the Options bar to close the shape picker.\nTo add the shape to your design, click in the image and shift drag to constrain proportions as you create the shape.\nRelease the mouse button and then the shift key.\nIn the Layers panel, there's now a shape layer.\nTo change the color of your star shape, double click the thumbnail on the shape layer and choose a color in the color picker.\nAs you click on different colors, the start shape changes color on the fly. I'll pick white and click OK to close the color picker.\nBecause this is a vector shape, you can edit it without degrading its quality.\nClick and hold down on the Path Selection Tool in the Tools panel.\nSelect the Direct Selection tool.\nClick inside the star, then drag any of the points that appear to change its shape.\nClick off the star when you're done.\nTo change the size of the shape, choose Edit, Free Transform.\nShift drag a corner inward to make the star smaller, then click the check mark in the Options bar to commit that change. Select the Move tool and drag the star shape into position on the left side of the text.\nMagenta smart guides may appear to help you align the star with the text.\nDuplicate the star shape by right clicking the shape layer in the Layers panel and choosing Duplicate Layer.\nClick OK.\nThen drag the copy of the star into position on the right side of the text.\nNext, we'll add a vector graphic, a logo that was made in another application, Adobe Illustrator.\nChoose File, Place Linked.\nSelect the logo with the dot AI suffix that was created in Illustrator and click Place.\nIn the next dialog box, leave the settings at Default and click OK.\nWith the logo in the image, you can transform it to fit the design.\nShift drag the corner of the bounding box around the logo to make it smaller.\nWhen the logo is the size you want it to be, release the mouse button and then the shift key.\nTo commit to placing the logo, click the check mark in the Options bar, or you can press Enter or Return on the keyboard and drag the logo into position in the center of the design.\nNotice that the new logo also has its own layer and it's right above the last selected layer.\nThis is a smart object layer which means that I can scale, rotate, and otherwise transform the logo on this layer without degrading its quality.\nIf I were to double click the thumbnail on this layer, the logo would open in Illustrator for editing.\nEdits made in Illustrator would affect this linked copy of the logo here in my Photoshop design.\nIn order to make it easier to organize our layer content in the Layers panel and work with multiple layers, you can group content.\nWe'll group all of the text, the stars, and the sun together.\nClick the Great American West type layer to select it.\nPress the Command or Control key and click the THE type layer, the two star shape layers, and the sun layer to select them all.\nClick the Create a New Group button at the bottom of the panel to make a group and automatically add those layers to the new group.\nClick the arrow to the left of the group name to see the five layers again.\nWith the layer group selected in the Layers panel and the move tool selected in the Tools panel, drag all grouped artwork into final position in the design.\nAs I said earlier, vector graphics are great because you can freely move or scale them without losing detail or clarity, and there are so many ways to create vector content within Photoshop, even bringing in vector artwork from other programs like Adobe Illustrator.",

surrounding area as shown here in this before and after example.\nWhile you can do all of your retouching on the original image layer, I like to retouch on separate layers in order to protect my original image and to increase editing flexibility.\nI'll delete the layers I made by tapping the Delete or Backspace key on my keyboard so we can recreate them together.\nI'll zoom in to the image by pressing and holding the Cmd key on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows and then tapping the Plus key on my keyboard a few times.\nOnce zoomed in, you can reposition the image on screen by pressing and holding the Spacebar on your keyboard and then dragging with your mouse.\nLet's start with the Spot Healing Brush as it's the easiest to use and it's great for removing small objects like the cows in this pasture and some of the more distracting poles.\nStart by creating a new layer by choosing Layer, New, Layer, and enter \"spot healing\" into the Name field and click OK.\nAlternatively, you can create a new layer by clicking the New Layer icon at the bottom right of the Layers panel.\nIn the Tools panel, activate the Spot Healing Brush and in the Options bar, make sure the Content-Aware button is highlighted.\nNow turn on Sample All Layers to have Photoshop look through the currently active yet empty layer to layers underneath where the pixels actually live.\nMouse over to your image and make the Brush Size slightly larger than the item you want to remove.\nYou can tap the Right Bracket key on your keyboard in increase Brush Size or the Left Bracket key to decrease it.\nNow put your cursor at the item you want to remove and click.\nWhen you do, Photoshop uses pixels immediately outside the brush cursor to remove the item.\nYou can also click and drag with this tool.\nFor example, we can decrease Brush Size even further and then click and drag to remove some of these more distracting poles.\nAs you can see, Photoshop is doing an incredible job removing these items from the photograph.\nReposition the image again by pressing and holding the Spacebar and then dragging with your mouse so you can see all the distracting items that you need to remove.\nNow if you don't like the results of one of the removals, you can always undo it and try again.\nSo let's choose Edit, Undo Spot Healing Brush, and then let's have another go by using a slightly smaller brush cursor and by making shorter brush strokes.\nTo remove the boat in the foreground, let's increase Brush Size so the boat fits within the brush cursor and give it a single click.\nReposition the image again.\nNow to remove larger items such as this red roof here, you'll get a better result if you tell Photoshop where to copy the pixels from which you can do using the Patch Tool.\nSo let's begin by adding another new empty layer by choosing Layer, New, Layer.\nLet's enter \"patch\" into the Name field and click OK.\nIn the Tools panel, click and hold your mouse atop the Spot Healing Brush and from the menu that appears, choose Patch Tool.\nIn the Options bar, set the Patch menu to Content-Aware and then turn on Sample All Layers.\nIf you don't see the Sample All Layers check box, then you forgot to choose Content-Aware from the Patch menu.\nNow click and drag to draw a rough selection around the item you want to remove.\nBe sure to make the selection slightly larger than the item itself.\nOtherwise, you may end up with a ghostly outline of it.\nTo tell Photoshop where to copy pixels from, click inside the selection and then drag it to the area in the image you want Photoshop to use for the patch.\nWhen you release your mouse button, Photoshop performs the patch and blends it with surrounding pixels.\nWhile the selection is still active, be sure to experiment with the structure and color fields in the Options bar.\nTo preserve more of the texture from the area that you copied pixels from, increase the Structure slider.\nTo preserve less of the texture, decrease it.\nTo perform more color blending between the two areas, increase the Color slider.\nTo perform less color blending, decrease it.\nWhen everything looks good, deactivate the selection by choosing Select, Deselect.\nNow let's choose View, Fit on Screen, and assess the removals by turning off the visibility of the layers we added in this video.\nAs you can see, the Spot Healing Brush and Patch Tools did a great job to clean up this image.\nI'll turn those layers back on in the same way.\nNow choose File, Save to save your document again with these changes.\nThe Photoshop format preserves your content removal layers so you can continue to edit them in the future.\nIn the next video, you'll get creative with this image as you learn how to blur parts of it using a filter, how to turn it into a beautiful black and white, and how to add a color tint.",

It recommends working on separate layers to protect the original image and allow flexible editing. The Spot Healing Brush is ideal for small objects and works by blending pixels from surrounding areas. Users can adjust brush size and undo mistakes easily. For larger objects, the Patch Tool is preferred, allowing users to select an area and specify where Photoshop should sample pixels for a seamless patch. Adjusting the Structure and Color sliders helps refine texture and color blending. After editing, users can toggle layer visibility to assess changes and save the document in Photoshop format to preserve layers for future edits. The next tutorial will cover creative effects like blurring, black and white conversion, and color tinting.",

I'll position my cursor at the top left corner of the door and drag diagonally down to the right to define a selection of the door that overlaps just a bit onto the white areas.\nWith my Selection tool still active, I can click inside the selection and move it upwards.\nIf I press the Shift key after I start dragging the selection, it will constrain the motion vertically.\nI want to move this selection up to the point where the arch above begins to noticeably curve inward.\nNext, I need to add on to my current selection to include the arched window.\nI'll switch to the Elliptical Marquee Tool.\nI'll select the Add to Selection icon in the Options bar, to tell Photoshop to add to the current selection.\nI'll click near the upper left part of the arched window and drag out an elliptical selection.\nAs I make the ellipse larger, I can temporarily interrupt the selection by pressing the Space bar while still holding the mouse button down.\nThis allows me to drag to reposition the selection and align it, so it fits better to the actual shape of the arch.\nI'll release the Space bar with my mouse still held down to return to dragging out the selection.\nThere, that looks pretty good.\nI'll release the mouse button to finish the selection.\nI can use this selection to add black to the layer mask and hide the selected areas.\nIn the Layers Panel, I'll click on the Layer Mask thumbnail for the Door layer to make sure that it's active.\nBlack is currently my foreground color, so I'll use the shortcut of Option + Delete on Mac or Alt + Backspace on Windows to fill the selection with black.\nIf you look at the Layer Mask thumbnail, you can see that this area has been filled with black which hides that part of the Door layer.\nI don't need the selection any more, so I'll choose Select, Deselect.\nNow I need to mask out the bottom part of the door, below the horizon.\nI'll switch to the Brush tool.\nI'll click on the Brush menu in the Options bar to set the hardness to about 50 percent.\nI'll keep the brush size fairly large.\nI'll position my brush on the left side of the door with the top edge of the circular brush cursor right on the horizon.\nI'll click once and release the mouse button.\nThen move the brush cursor to the right side of the door, position the top edge the brush on the horizon line and Shift + Click to draw a straight line between the two clicks.\nNow, I'll quickly brush over the rest of the door down below to mask it out.\nUsing selections in the Brush tool as I have done here, are common way is to modify layer masks, so that they reveal only the areas you want to see on a layer.",

The red brick areas are selected and masked out using the Quick Selection Tool and layer masks to reveal only the white column and arched entryway. The door is further hidden by making precise selections with the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee Tools, then filling these selections with black on the layer mask. Adjustments are made to ensure the door fits naturally within the arch shape. Finally, the bottom part of the door below the horizon is masked out using a brush with medium hardness, applying straight lines and brushing to refine the mask. These techniques combine selections and brush tools to control layer visibility and blend elements seamlessly into the scene.",

        "page_content": "If you like to print images, it can be useful for you to have a basic understanding of what image resolution means in Photoshop CC, and how to change the resolution of an image to prepare it for print.\nThat's done in the Image Size dialog box.\nIf you're following along, let's open this image, that you'll find in the practice files for this tutorial.\nAnd then go up to the Image menu, and choose Image Size...\nIn the Image Size dialog box, you can see the Dimensions of this image reported in pixels.\nWhen an image is still on your computer, that's how we measure its size, in pixels.\nBut if we were to print this image, we would measure the size of the print in inches, not pixels.\nDown here in the Resolution field, you can see the resolution that's currently set for this image, it's 100.\nThere's nothing special about a resolution of 100, it's just a round number that I picked when I set up the file for this lesson.\nNow, what does Resolution mean here?\nWell, if you read across this line from left to right, you may get a sense of it.\nThis is telling us that resolution is a particular number of Pixels/Inch, in this case 100 Pixels/Inch.\nAnother way to say that, is that if and when you print this image, 100 pixels out of the total 1800 across and the total 1200 down, will be assigned to every printed inch, horizontally and vertically.\nNow if you don't like math problems, you can skip the next part, but if you like to think of this in terms of math, here's a simple example.\nSo, the math problem is: divide 1800 by 100 and you get 18.\nThat means that at resolution of 100 pixels per inch, this file will print at 18 inches across.\nAnd it works the same way vertically.\nIf we divide the total, 1200 pixels of height into groups of 100, that gives you 12 groups or 12 inches.\nSo, the height of the printed image will be 12 inches.\nSo, if you understand that basic concept, now you're probably wondering, well what's the best number to put in the Resolution field when you're preparing an image for print?\nUnfortunately, there's no one answer because that depends on what printer you're using.\nBut assuming you're printing at home on a typical inkjet printer, it's fair to say, that a resolution of about 300 pixels per inch will do.\nIf I were to print the image with only 100 pixels per inch, it might look OK, but if you got really close to it, it wouldn't look its best.\nBecause my desktop inkjet printer really needs around 300 pixels per inch.\nSo how do you go about changing the resolution of a printed image to 300 pixels per inch in this dialogue box?\nThe first step is to make sure that the Resample box is unchecked.\nBecause if we're just changing the resolution, we probably don't want to change the total number of pixels in the file.\nAnd that's what Resample does.\nSo, let's say that we want the total number of pixels in the file to remain at 1800 by 1200.\nWe just want to reallocate them into groups of 300 rather than groups of 100.\nSo, what I'm going to do is type 300 in the Resolution field.\nSpoiler alert: when I do that, the number of inches in the Width and Height fields will change too.\nSo, let's go ahead and type 300 here.\nAnd sure enough the Width and Height have changed from 18 inches and 12 inches, to 6 inches by 4 inches.\nAnd that's the size at which this image will print with the necessary resolution to make the best print.\nI'm done here, so I'm going to click OK.\nThat closes the Image Size dialog box and takes me back out to the Document window.\nAnd here I have an image ready to save and print at 6 inches by 4 inches, with 300 pixels in every inch.",

        "summary": "Image resolution in Photoshop CC determines how many pixels are printed per inch, affecting print size and quality. Resolution is measured in pixels per inch (PPI), and changing it reallocates pixels without altering the total pixel count if resampling is off. For example, an image with 1800 by 1200 pixels at 100 PPI prints at 18 by 12 inches, but at 300 PPI, it prints at 6 by 4 inches with higher quality. Typical home inkjet printers require about 300 PPI for the best print quality. To change resolution, open the Image Size dialog, uncheck Resample, and enter the desired PPI. This adjusts the print dimensions while keeping pixel data intact. Understanding and adjusting resolution ensures images print at the correct size and quality.",

        "page_content": "Layers are the building blocks of any image in Photoshop CC.\nSo, it's important to understand, what layers are and why to use them - which we'll cover in this video.\nIf you're following along, open this layered image from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial.\nYou might think of layers like separate flat pints of glass, stacked one on top of the other.\nEach layer contains separate pieces of content.\nTo get a sense of how layers are constructed, let's take a look at this Layers panel.\nI've closed my other panels, so that we can focus on the Layers panel.\nBut you can skip that.\nBy the way: If your Layers panel isn't showing, go up to the Window menu and choose Layers from there.\nThe Layers panel is where you go to select and work with layers.\nIn this image there are 4 layers, each with separate content.\nIf you click the Eye icon to the left of a layer, you can toggle the visibility of that layer off and on.\nSo, I'm going to turn off the visibility of the tailor layer.\nAnd keep your eye on the image, so you can see what's on that layer.\nI'll do the same for the cloth layer and for the pattern layer.\nYou can see that the bottom layer, the Background layer, is filled with white, because this image started with a new blank image preset with a white background.\nLet's turn on all the other layers again by clicking in the empty box just to the left of each layer to add the Eye icon back in.\nNow let's take a look at just one layer, the tailor layer.\nA quick way to turn off all the layers except the tailor layer, is to hold down the Option key on the Mac, or the ALT key on the PC, and click on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer.\nIn the Document window, you can see that this layer contains just the one small photo surrounded by a gray and white checkerboard pattern.\nThat pattern represents transparent pixels, which allow us to see down through the corresponding part of this layer to the content of the layers below.\nSo, let's turn that content back on by going back to the Layers panel, again holding the Option key on the Mac or the ALT key on the PC and clicking on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer.\nAnd all the other layers and their Eye icons come back into view.\nSo again: You might think of layers like a stack of pints of glass, each with its own artwork and in some cases transparent areas that let you see down through to the layers below.\nThe biggest benefit of having items on separate layers like this, is that you'll be able to edit pieces of an image independently without affecting the rest of the image.\nFollow along with this example to see what I mean.\nLet's say you wanted to edit or move just the small photo of the cloth being cut.\nTo do that, you'd have to select the layer that contains that photo.\nGo to the Layers panel and click on the cloth layer just to the right of the layer name.\nNow that the cloth layer is selected, any editing you do will affect only that layer.\nFor example, go to the Tools panel and select the Move tool and then click on the cloth photo and drag - and only that photo moves, because only that layer is selected.\nAnd this applies to other kinds of edits too.\nFor example, if you painted on the image or applied a filter, as you'll do later in this tutorial series, those edits would affect only the selected cloth layer and not the rest of the image.\nBy the way: There are some editing activities, like moving layers, that you can do to more than one layer at a time.\nAnd to do that, you need to select more than one layer.\nOver in the Layers panel, we already have the cloth layer selected.\nIf you don't, click on that layer.\nTo select the tailor layer too, hold down the Command key on a Mac or the Ctrl key on a PC, and click on the tailor layer.\nWith both layers selected, you can click and drag either of those photos and they'll move together.\nNow here's a bonus tip: With the Move tool selected, take a look at its Options bar.\nAnd you'll see this option, Auto-Select: Layer is checked.\nWith that option checked, clicking anywhere in the image will automatically select the top layer at that location that contains content.\nFor example, watch the Layers panel as I click over here on the pattern photo and you'll see that the pattern layer was automatically selected for you in the Layers panel.\nSometimes that's really useful, but sometimes it can cause you to inadvertently select a layer that you didn't mean to.\nTo avoid that you can uncheck Auto-Select: Layer in the Move tool Options bar and instead select layers manually by clicking on them in the Layers panel, as we did in this tutorial.\nSo, to recap: Being able to work with selected pieces of content independently is the biggest benefit of using layers.\nThere's lots more to learn about layers, so stay tuned for the rest of this tutorial.",

        "summary": "Layers in Photoshop CC are like stacked transparent sheets, each containing separate content that can be edited independently. The Layers panel is used to select, toggle visibility, and manage these layers. Transparent areas in layers allow viewing content from layers below. Editing or moving content affects only the selected layer, enabling precise control over image elements. Multiple layers can be selected and moved together by using keyboard shortcuts. The Move tool's Auto-Select option can automatically select layers by clicking on image content, but it can be disabled to avoid accidental selections. Understanding and using layers effectively is essential for flexible and non-destructive image editing in Photoshop.",

        "page_content": "When you shoot with a camera or a phone, you don't always get a perfect exposure.\nA photo may come out too dark or too light.\nOr it may lack contrast and look dull.\nOr it may be too contrasty and have really dark darks and bright brights.\nThe simplest way to correct exposure problems like those is with a Brightness/Contrast adjustment.\nLet's try it out on this image from the practice files for this tutorial, or on a slightly dark, slightly dull photograph of your own.\nFirst, take a quick look at the Layers panel and make sure that you have the layer with the photograph selected.\nWhen you are working with photographs, often you'll have only one layer.\nThen go up to the Image menu at the top of the screen.\nAnd from there, go to the Adjustments category.\nWe're going to try the first adjustment: Brightness/Contrast...\nThat opens this Brightness/Contrast dialog box which I've moved over to the side, so we can see the image.\nThe fastest way to make a change here, is to click the Auto button.\nThat would move the Brightness and Contrast sliders here to where Photoshop CC thinks they should be.\nBut if you want more control, you can move the sliders yourself.\nThe Brightness slider is sometimes all you need.\nIt controls the overall lightness or darkness of an image.\nFor example, if I drag it to the right, notice that the photo is getting brighter.\nIf I would go to the left, the photo would be darker.\nI'm going to take it to the right of where we started which was 0, brightening up the photo quite a bit.\nBy the way, don't feel that you have to use the same values I'm using, either in this video or anywhere in this tutorial.\nThe right amount is up to you and your taste.\nSometimes, as I said, increasing or decreasing brightness is all you have to do to improve a dark or light photo.\nBut there's another slider here too, the Contrast slider.\nThis slider controls the range of light and dark tones in an image.\nIf you increase contrast, I'll drag the Contrast slider way over, so you can see what it does.\nThe dark tones in the image get darker, and the bright tones get brighter.\nToo much contrast like this, can make it difficult to see detail in the shadow areas, like in these flowers here or over here, and can cause a loss of detail in bright highlight areas.\nLike up here in the background.\nSo that's what high contrast looks like.\nLet's go to the other extreme and pull this slider, all the way to the left.\nAnd now you can see what a low contrast image might look like.\nA little bit flat, a little bit dull.\nI'm going to put Contrast back where I started, at 0 by typing 0 into the value field for the Contrast slider.\nSo, I think this image could use a little more pop.\nTherefore, I'm going to drag the Contrast slider just slightly to the right.\nAnd that will often do the trick.\nOne way to help you evaluate whether your changes have really improved the image, is to see it before and after view.\nAnd you can do that by clicking the Check box next to Preview in this dialog.\nSo, there's how the image started.\nAnd here's how it looks, with the increased brightness and contrast that we applied.\nWhen you're satisfied, click OK.\nAnd that applies your changes directly to the selected layer, in this case to the photograph.\nIf you don't like them, you still have a chance to undo or step backwards as we learned to do earlier in this series.\nBut just to make sure you can always get back to the original, I suggest that when you save an image you've adjusted, like this, you choose Save As... rather than Save.\nAnd give the file a different name.\nAnd then click the Save button.\nNow a direct Brightness/Contrast adjustment, like the one we used, is not the only way to correct exposure problems.\nLater in this tutorial, we'll learn how to apply an adjustment more flexibly, as a readable adjustment layer.\nAnd there are other ways to tackle exposure too.\nLike levels and curves adjustments, that you'll explore as you get more experienced with Photoshop CC.\nBut the Brightness/Contrast adjustment is a relatively simple solution, that can often improve the look of your photos.",

        "summary": "Brightness and contrast adjustments in Photoshop CC help correct exposure issues like photos being too dark, too light, dull, or overly contrasty. The Brightness slider controls the overall lightness or darkness, while the Contrast slider adjusts the range between light and dark tones. Increasing contrast makes darks darker and brights brighter but can cause loss of detail, while decreasing contrast results in a flat, dull image. Users can apply automatic adjustments or manually move sliders to achieve the desired effect. The Preview option allows comparing before and after views to evaluate changes. After adjustments, clicking OK applies changes directly to the selected layer, and it's recommended to save edited images with a new name to preserve the original. Brightness/Contrast is a simple and effective method, but other tools like levels, curves, and adjustment layers offer more flexible exposure corrections. These techniques will be explored further as users gain experience with Photoshop CC.",

After selecting the object with tools like the Lasso tool, users choose Edit > Fill and select Content-Aware to automatically replace the object with surrounding textures. The tool blends the filled area seamlessly with the background, effectively removing the unwanted object. If any blurry spots remain, the Clone Stamp Tool can be used to restore texture by sampling nearby clear areas and painting over the blur. Adjusting the Clone Stamp's opacity and brush size helps achieve a natural look. Finally, the edited image can be saved in Photoshop format. This method enables significant image changes with just a few simple steps.",

        "page_content": "When you add text to an image in Photoshop CC it automatically appears on a special kind of layer called a type layer.\nText on a type layer remains editable so that you can always change its content or its appearance.\nAnd it has smooth edges when printed, even if you make the text a lot bigger.\nIn this video we'll practice adding text to an image.\nYou can use this image from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial or an image of your own.\nThe tool you use most often to create text is the Horizontal Type tool.\nYou can select it here in the Tools panel.\nThen go up to the Options bar and click on the Font menu.\nHere you'll see a list of fonts that you can scroll through to choose one you like.\nThe list shows you a preview of what each font looks like.\nOr if you know the font that you want you can just type it here in the font field. I'll type Georgia.\nAnd Photoshop CC shows you all available styles of that font.\nI'll choose Georgia Bold.\nIf you don't have this font, choose a font of your own.\nNext let's set the font size.\nThis menu shows you the font size in points by default.\nBy the way: The default size is very small on a large image like this.\nIf you ever enter type and you can't see it, that's probably why.\nSo just try again with a larger font size.\nHere you can type in a font size if you know it or you can click this arrow and choose a font size from the drop-down menu.\nI'll choose a large font size.\nLet's use white for the text we're going to enter.\nTo set the font color go up to the Options bar and click the Font Color field.\nThat opens the Color Picker, which we covered in an earlier tutorial in this series.\nTo select white here go to the large field on the left and click on white and then click OK.\nIf you want to type uppercase letters, as I do, press the Caps lock key on your keyboard.\nThen click in the image and start typing.\nI'm going to type the name of a fictional tailor business.\nYou can type any name you like.\nAfter you enter or edit text you always have to accept it.\nOne way to do that is to go up to the Options bar and click the big Checkmark there.\nIf the text isn't where you want it, then go to the Tools panel and select the Move tool.\nClick in the image and drag the text where you want it.\nNow take a look at the Layers panel.\nYou'll see that Photoshop CC has created a new layer for you and has even named it for you.\nThe T icon on the layer indicates that this is a special re-editable type layer.\nNow let's say you want another type layer.\nUsing multiple type layers will let you work with and position each one separately, just like regular layers.\nSo let's go back to the Tools panel and select the Horizontal Type tool again.\nThen move into the image and hold down the Shift key, as you click to start a new type layer.\nThat assures that the new text will end up on its own layer rather than tacked on to the end of the first layer, which can happen if you start making one type layer too close to another.\nLet's choose some different options for this type layer.\nI'll go up to the Font menu and this time I'm going to choose a different font and a smaller font size.\nAnd then I'll start typing.\nYou can type what you like.\nAt the end of the first line I'm going to press the Return or the Enter key on the keyboard to add another line of type on the same type layer.\nWhen you're finished typing, go up to the Options bar and click the big Checkmark.\nAs long as you still have the type layer selected in the Layers panel and you still have the Horizontal Type tool selected in the Tools panel, you can change the options for this type layer.\nFor example, if I want the 2 lines of type on this layer to be center-aligned, here in the Options bar I'll click the Center Align icon.\nThen select the Move tool in the Tools panel and click on the new text and drag it where you want it.\nAnd now there's another type layer over in the Layers panel.\nWhen you're finished, go to the File menu and choose Save As... In the Save As dialog box it's important to save in the Photoshop format and to leave Layers checked in order to retain your editable type layers in this working version of the file.\nIf you need a copy to share, you can save another copy as a JPEG.\nBut the JPEG won't retain your type layers.\nSo those are the basics of creating text.\nStay tuned for the next video where we'll see how to edit text.",

The Horizontal Type tool is used to add text, allowing font, size, and color customization via the Options bar. You can type uppercase letters using Caps Lock and accept text edits by clicking the Checkmark. Multiple type layers can be created by holding Shift while typing, enabling separate positioning and styling. Text alignment and movement are adjustable using the Options bar and Move tool. The Layers panel shows each type layer with a T icon, indicating re-editable text. To preserve editable layers, save the file in Photoshop format with Layers checked. JPEG copies do not retain type layers. This tutorial covers the basics of creating and managing text layers in Photoshop.",

        "page_content": "Did you ever want to replace a blend or distracting image background?\nIn this video, we'll do just that.\nAnd we'll learn more about layer masking in the process.\nWe'll start with this photo from the practice files of an art piece by a wood artist.\nLet's replace its background with a more interesting shot from the artist studio.\nThe first step is to bring in another background image.\nTo do that go up to the File menu, choose Place Embedded..., and navigate to this image and click Place.\nGo to the Options bar and click the Checkmark.\nOver in the Layers panel, there's a brand-new layer with the new image.\nWe need to drag that new layer beneath the original Background layer.\nBut we can't do that, because the Background layer is a locked layer.\nIf you just wanted to unlock this layer, you could click this Lock icon.\nBut if you want to unlock the layer and rename it, all in one step, then select the Background layer by clicking on it, and then right click or hold down the Control key and click if you're on a Mac, and choose Layer from Background.\nAnd in the New Layer dialog box that appears, type a new name for this layer.\nI'll call it Pencil and then click OK.\nNow select the Replace_Background2 layer and click, hold and drag beneath the Pencil layer.\nYou can release your finger from the mouse or trackpad when you see a double line under the Pencil layer.\nThe next thing we're going to do, is make a selection of the background, and at that point you could delete it from the image completely, but that would be a permanent change, and wouldn't leave you very much editing flexibility.\nTo do it a more flexible way, we're going to use a selection with a layer mask.\nTo see what I mean, click on the Pencil layer in the Layers panel.\nGo over to the Tools panel.\nAnd select the Quick Selection tool.\nNow you could select either the foreground object or the background.\nSo just click and drag over the background to select it.\nBefore we apply a layer mask, we need to have the item that we want to show, not the item that we want to hide selected.\nSo, we need to invert this selection.\nGo up to the Select menu and choose Inverse.\nNow go to the Layers panel, and click the Create New Layer Mask icon at the bottom of that panel.\nThat was a real time-saver because Photoshop CC not only created a layer mask, it also filled in the area that wasn't selected on that layer mask with black.\nAnd where a layer mask is black, it hides the content on the layer to which it's attached, the Pencil layer.\nWhere a layer mask is white, it shows the content on that layer.\nOn this mask, the white is showing the pencil and the black is hiding the pencil.\nSo, we can see down through to the new background layer below.\nIf you're happy with that result, you're done.\nYou've achieved your goal of replacing the background image.\nBut here's a bonus option: You can try to fine-tune the mask to make it look even better.\nTo do that, go up to the Select menu and choose Select and Mask...\nThat opens the image with the mask applied, here in the special selected mask workspace.\nEarlier in this tutorial series, we visited this workspace when we were fine-tuning a selection.\nNow we're fine-tuning a mask which is very similar.\nFirst, let's click on the View menu and choose the way we'll view the image in this workspace.\nI'm going to choose On Layers which will let us see exactly how the pencil will look against the new background layer as we adjust the mask.\nI'll click on a blank area to close the View menu, and then I'll go to the Global Refinement section of this dialog box.\nHere there are sliders that often work well when you're trying to isolate a hard-edged image, like this pencil.\nKeep your eye on this white halo along the edge of the pencil that we want to remove, as I go to the Shift Edge slider, and I move it to the left.\nAnd what I'm doing is contracting the mask so that it's hiding that edge.\nYou also can try dragging the Smooth slider to the right, to smooth out the edge of that mask and I might try dragging the Contrast slider to the right, to make the edge along the pencil a little more contrasty or crisp.\nWhen you're done with the sliders, scroll down and make sure the Output to menu is set to Layer Mask, and then click OK.\nAnd that modifies the layer mask that we already had applied to the Pencil layer.\nOne last thing: Notice that there's a Link icon between the layer mask thumbnail and the image thumbnail on the Pencil layer.\nThat means that if we were to move the Pencil layer, the layer mask would go with it.\nGo over to the Tools panel, and get the Move tool, and then click on the pencil and drag it over to the right.\nNow all that's left to do is to save the image, and you want to be sure to use the Save As... command, and save in the Photoshop - the PSD format - so that you retain your layers and this layer mask, so that you have the flexibility to come back in in the future and fine-tune your layer mask further if you want to.",

        "summary": "This tutorial explains how to replace a distracting image background using layer masking in Photoshop. It starts by placing a new background image beneath the original, unlocked and renamed layer. A selection of the background is made with the Quick Selection tool, then inverted to select the foreground object. A layer mask is created to hide the original background non-destructively, revealing the new background layer. The mask can be fine-tuned in the Select and Mask workspace using sliders like Shift Edge, Smooth, and Contrast to improve the edge quality. The tutorial also shows how to move the masked object while keeping the mask linked. Finally, it advises saving the file in PSD format to preserve layers and masks for future editing.",

        "page_content": "At any time when you're working in Adobe Photoshop on a complicated subject the possibility exists of chaos ensuing. Well, you know what chaos there is, don't you? It's my studio in the middle of a project. What I would like to do is reduce the clutter, reduce the chaos. Let me move Layers over here again, I would say that is not really necessary, but it makes life easier. I have an Andy's Funny Face character. Each one of the pieces of the face are in separate layers. Nothing wrong with that. It doesn't really hurt a thing, gives me total control. But I would like to reduce the clutter in my Layers panel by creating something called a Group. So let's do this a couple of ways. Number one, we can come down here and click this button right there. That's a \"Group\" button. Go and click it. It will give you a group called: Group 1. Now, there is nothing in it yet, it's just there. To get these elements in here is actually pretty easy. Select this one and \"Shift\" click down here - assuming you want them all. Now actually maybe you don't. Let me show you something else here. If you click on this one and hold down the \"Command\" key on a Macintosh or the \"Control\" key in Windows you can select, well, every other one if you want to. If you want to select them all - \"Shift\" click. Now I'll just drag them up to Group 1 Until you see a little box kind of come around Group 1 and let go. They should indent if it worked. And then we can close it off. I'm a big namer of stuff. So if we get into Group 1 and select it and type in: \"Face elements\" or something like that I suppose that would be good. There is a lot of advantage if you will, to doing what we just did. Number one: all the elements are in one area, it reduces the chaos or clutter inside your Layers panel. If we have the \"Move\" tool selected, which we do, we can move all of them at the same time. We can use our Locking mechanisms all at the same time, we can use our Opacity all at the same time, and we can Show/Hide all at the same time. If at any time we want to work on these individually, we can open it up and there you go. Now let's say, over the course of time that you decide, that you don't want to have these inside of a group. You could actually drag them out. Let me show you an easy way to do this. Select the group \"Face elements\". Now I actually go down and click this button, which is for deleting. It's going to ask you: Do you want to delete the Group and the Contents or just the Group? - Quickest way to do it. Click \"Group Only\" and they come right back out for you and now they are individual.",

        "page_content": "Another way to make a group, that's actually a little bit easier, is let's go ahead and select them all again. This time go into your options for \"Layers\" - this button right here and select \"New Group from Layers\". The cool thing is, it takes you right here and allows you to give it a name. Click \"OK\". You did it again. Let's talk about one more way to do this. Using searching. Let's say we have a complicated document that has a lot of stuff in it. We have a lot of type or text layers. That's a unique type of layer in the Layers panel, which got a bunch of them you've got a couple of hundred layers and these are scattered all over the place. And you want all of your type layers in one group. So we go to the Search facility here and click \"Kind\". And then click this button for just type layers. It isolates everything but those two. We select them with a \"Shift\" click, go up here, this is the easiest way to do it. Go into \"New Group from Layers\" and call it \"Text\" - type whatever you want. And then turn this back off again - here. And there you go. Creating groups gives you control, it reduces the chaos and clutter in the Layers panel and if at any time you change your mind, it's a very easy thing to take them back out again.",

I'll pick white and click OK to close the color picker.\nBecause this is a vector shape, you can edit it without degrading its quality.\nClick and hold down on the Path Selection Tool in the Tools panel.\nSelect the Direct Selection tool.\nClick inside the star, then drag any of the points that appear to change its shape.\nClick off the star when you're done.\nTo change the size of the shape, choose Edit, Free Transform.\nShift drag a corner inward to make the star smaller, then click the check mark in the Options bar to commit that change. Select the Move tool and drag the star shape into position on the left side of the text.\nMagenta smart guides may appear to help you align the star with the text.\nDuplicate the star shape by right clicking the shape layer in the Layers panel and choosing Duplicate Layer.\nClick OK.\nThen drag the copy of the star into position on the right side of the text.\nNext, we'll add a vector graphic, a logo that was made in another application, Adobe Illustrator.\nChoose File, Place Linked.\nSelect the logo with the dot AI suffix that was created in Illustrator and click Place.\nIn the next dialog box, leave the settings at Default and click OK.\nWith the logo in the image, you can transform it to fit the design.\nShift drag the corner of the bounding box around the logo to make it smaller.\nWhen the logo is the size you want it to be, release the mouse button and then the shift key.\nTo commit to placing the logo, click the check mark in the Options bar, or you can press Enter or Return on the keyboard and drag the logo into position in the center of the design.\nNotice that the new logo also has its own layer and it's right above the last selected layer.\nThis is a smart object layer which means that I can scale, rotate, and otherwise transform the logo on this layer without degrading its quality.\nIf I were to double click the thumbnail on this layer, the logo would open in Illustrator for editing.\nEdits made in Illustrator would affect this linked copy of the logo here in my Photoshop design.\nIn order to make it easier to organize our layer content in the Layers panel and work with multiple layers, you can group content.\nWe'll group all of the text, the stars, and the sun together.\nClick the Great American West type layer to select it.\nPress the Command or Control key and click the THE type layer, the two star shape layers, and the sun layer to select them all.\nClick the Create a New Group button at the bottom of the panel to make a group and automatically add those layers to the new group.\nClick the arrow to the left of the group name to see the five layers again.\nWith the layer group selected in the Layers panel and the move tool selected in the Tools panel, drag all grouped artwork into final position in the design.\nAs I said earlier, vector graphics are great because you can freely move or scale them without losing detail or clarity, and there are so many ways to create vector content within Photoshop, even bringing in vector artwork from other programs like Adobe Illustrator.",

        "page_content": "Spot Healing Brush and Patch tools to remove unwanted objects in a photo. Both tools do a great job of blending your retouches with the surrounding area as shown here in this before and after example. While you can do all of your retouching on the original image layer, I like to retouch on separate layers in order to protect my original image and to increase editing flexibility. I'll delete the layers I made by tapping the Delete or Backspace key on my keyboard so we can recreate them together. I'll zoom in to the image by pressing and holding the Cmd key on a Mac or Ctrl in Windows and then tapping the Plus key on my keyboard a few times. Once zoomed in, you can reposition the image on screen by pressing and holding the Spacebar on your keyboard and then dragging with your mouse. Let's start with the Spot Healing Brush as it's the easiest to use and it's great for removing small objects like the cows in this pasture and some of the more distracting poles. Start by creating a new layer by choosing Layer, New, Layer, and enter \"spot healing\" into the Name field and click OK. Alternatively, you can create a new layer by clicking the New Layer icon at the bottom right of the Layers panel. In the Tools panel, activate the Spot Healing Brush and in the Options bar, make sure the Content-Aware button is highlighted. Now turn on Sample All Layers to have Photoshop look through the currently active yet empty layer to layers underneath where the pixels actually live. Mouse over to your image and make the Brush Size slightly larger than the item you want to remove. You can tap the Right Bracket key on your keyboard in increase Brush Size or the Left Bracket key to decrease it. Now put your cursor at the item you want to remove and click. When you do, Photoshop uses pixels immediately outside the brush cursor to remove the item. You can also click and drag with this tool. For example, we can decrease Brush Size even further and then click and drag to remove some of these more distracting poles. As you can see, Photoshop is doing an incredible job removing these items from the photograph. Reposition the image again by pressing and holding the Spacebar and then dragging with your mouse so you can see all the distracting items that you need to remove. Now if you don't like the results of one of the removals, you can always undo it and try again. So let's choose Edit, Undo Spot Healing Brush, and then let's have another go by using a slightly smaller brush cursor and by making shorter brush strokes. To remove the boat in the foreground, let's increase Brush Size so the boat fits within the brush cursor and give it a single click. Reposition the image again. Now to remove larger items such as this red roof here, you'll get a better result if you tell Photoshop where to copy the pixels from which you can do using the",

In the Tools panel, click and hold your mouse atop the Spot Healing Brush and from the menu that appears, choose Patch Tool. In the Options bar, set the Patch menu to Content-Aware and then turn on Sample All Layers. If you don't see the Sample All Layers check box, then you forgot to choose Content-Aware from the Patch menu. Now click and drag to draw a rough selection around the item you want to remove. Be sure to make the selection slightly larger than the item itself. Otherwise, you may end up with a ghostly outline of it. To tell Photoshop where to copy pixels from, click inside the selection and then drag it to the area in the image you want Photoshop to use for the patch. When you release your mouse button, Photoshop performs the patch and blends it with surrounding pixels. While the selection is still active, be sure to experiment with the structure and color fields in the Options bar. To preserve more of the texture from the area that you copied pixels from, increase the Structure slider. To preserve less of the texture, decrease it. To perform more color blending between the two areas, increase the Color slider. To perform less color blending, decrease it. When everything looks good, deactivate the selection by choosing Select, Deselect. Now let's choose View, Fit on Screen, and assess the removals by turning off the visibility of the layers we added in this video. As you can see, the Spot Healing Brush and Patch Tools did a great job to clean up this image. I'll turn those layers back on in the same way. Now choose File, Save to save your document again with these changes. The Photoshop format preserves your content removal layers so you can continue to edit them in the future. In the next video, you'll get creative with this image as you learn how to blur parts of it using a filter, how to turn it into a beautiful black and white, and how to add a color tint.",

I'll position my cursor at the top left corner of the door and drag diagonally down to the right to define a selection of the door that overlaps just a bit onto the white areas.\nWith my Selection tool still active, I can click inside the selection and move it upwards.\nIf I press the Shift key after I start dragging the selection, it will constrain the motion vertically.\nI want to move this selection up to the point where the arch above begins to noticeably curve inward.\nNext, I need to add on to my current selection to include the arched window.\nI'll switch to the Elliptical Marquee Tool.\nI'll select the Add to Selection icon in the Options bar, to tell Photoshop to add to the current selection.\nI'll click near the upper left part of the arched window and drag out an elliptical selection.\nAs I make the ellipse larger, I can temporarily interrupt the selection by pressing the Space bar while still holding the mouse button down.\nThis allows me to drag to reposition the selection and align it, so it fits better to the actual shape of the arch.\nI'll release the Space bar with my mouse still held down to return to dragging out the selection.\nThere, that looks pretty good.\nI'll release the mouse button to finish the selection.\nI can use this selection to add black to the layer mask and hide the selected areas.\nIn the Layers Panel, I'll click on the Layer Mask thumbnail for the Door layer to make sure that it's active.\nBlack is currently my foreground color, so I'll use the shortcut of Option + Delete on Mac or Alt + Backspace on Windows to fill the selection with black.\nIf you look at the Layer Mask thumbnail, you can see that this area has been filled with black which hides that part of the Door layer.\nI don't need the selection any more, so I'll choose Select, Deselect.\nNow I need to mask out the bottom part of the door, below the horizon.\nI'll switch to the Brush tool.\nI'll click on the Brush menu in the Options bar to set the hardness to about 50 percent.\nI'll keep the brush size fairly large.\nI'll position my brush on the left side of the door with the top edge of the circular brush cursor right on the horizon.\nI'll click once and release the mouse button.\nThen move the brush cursor to the right side of the door, position the top edge the brush on the horizon line and Shift + Click to draw a straight line between the two clicks.\nNow, I'll quickly brush over the rest of the door down below to mask it out.\nUsing selections in the Brush tool as I have done here, are common way is to modify layer masks, so that they reveal only the areas you want to see on a layer.",

The red brick areas are selected and masked out using the Quick Selection Tool and layer masks to reveal only the white column and arched entryway. The door is further hidden by making precise selections with the Rectangular and Elliptical Marquee Tools, then filling these selections with black on the layer mask. Adjustments are made to ensure the door fits naturally within the arch shape. Finally, the bottom part of the door below the horizon is masked out using a brush with medium hardness, applying straight lines and brushing to refine the mask. These techniques combine selections and brush tools to control layer visibility and blend elements seamlessly into the scene.",

        "page_content": "If you like to print images, it can be useful for you to have a basic understanding of what image resolution means in Photoshop CC, and how to change the resolution of an image to prepare it for print.\nThat's done in the Image Size dialog box.\nIf you're following along, let's open this image, that you'll find in the practice files for this tutorial.\nAnd then go up to the Image menu, and choose Image Size...\nIn the Image Size dialog box, you can see the Dimensions of this image reported in pixels.\nWhen an image is still on your computer, that's how we measure its size, in pixels.\nBut if we were to print this image, we would measure the size of the print in inches, not pixels.\nDown here in the Resolution field, you can see the resolution that's currently set for this image, it's 100.\nThere's nothing special about a resolution of 100, it's just a round number that I picked when I set up the file for this lesson.\nNow, what does Resolution mean here?\nWell, if you read across this line from left to right, you may get a sense of it.\nThis is telling us that resolution is a particular number of Pixels/Inch, in this case 100 Pixels/Inch.\nAnother way to say that, is that if and when you print this image, 100 pixels out of the total 1800 across and the total 1200 down, will be assigned to every printed inch, horizontally and vertically.\nNow if you don't like math problems, you can skip the next part, but if you like to think of this in terms of math, here's a simple example.\nSo, the math problem is: divide 1800 by 100 and you get 18.\nThat means that at resolution of 100 pixels per inch, this file will print at 18 inches across.\nAnd it works the same way vertically.\nIf we divide the total, 1200 pixels of height into groups of 100, that gives you 12 groups or 12 inches.\nSo, the height of the printed image will be 12 inches.\nSo, if you understand that basic concept, now you're probably wondering, well what's the best number to put in the Resolution field when you're preparing an image for print?\nUnfortunately, there's no one answer because that depends on what printer you're using.\nBut assuming you're printing at home on a typical inkjet printer, it's fair to say, that a resolution of about 300 pixels per inch will do.\nIf I were to print the image with only 100 pixels per inch, it might look OK, but if you got really close to it, it wouldn't look its best.\nBecause my desktop inkjet printer really needs around 300 pixels per inch.\nSo how do you go about changing the resolution of a printed image to 300 pixels per inch in this dialogue box?\nThe first step is to make sure that the Resample box is unchecked.\nBecause if we're just changing the resolution, we probably don't want to change the total number of pixels in the file.\nAnd that's what Resample does.\nSo, let's say that we want the total number of pixels in the file to remain at 1800 by 1200.\nWe just want to reallocate them into groups of 300 rather than groups of 100.\nSo, what I'm going to do is type 300 in the Resolution field.\nSpoiler alert: when I do that, the number of inches in the Width and Height fields will change too.\nSo, let's go ahead and type 300 here.\nAnd sure enough the Width and Height have changed from 18 inches and 12 inches, to 6 inches by 4 inches.\nAnd that's the size at which this image will print with the necessary resolution to make the best print.\nI'm done here, so I'm going to click OK.\nThat closes the Image Size dialog box and takes me back out to the Document window.\nAnd here I have an image ready to save and print at 6 inches by 4 inches, with 300 pixels in every inch.",

        "summary": "Image resolution in Photoshop CC determines how many pixels are printed per inch, affecting print size and quality. Resolution is measured in pixels per inch (PPI), and changing it reallocates pixels without altering the total pixel count if resampling is off. For example, an image with 1800 by 1200 pixels at 100 PPI prints at 18 by 12 inches, but at 300 PPI, it prints at 6 by 4 inches with higher quality. Typical home inkjet printers require about 300 PPI for the best print quality. To change resolution, open the Image Size dialog, uncheck Resample, and enter the desired PPI. This adjusts the print dimensions while keeping pixel data intact. Understanding and adjusting resolution ensures images print at the correct size and quality.",

        "page_content": "Layers are the building blocks of any image in Photoshop CC.\nSo, it's important to understand, what layers are and why to use them - which we'll cover in this video.\nIf you're following along, open this layered image from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial.\nYou might think of layers like separate flat pints of glass, stacked one on top of the other.\nEach layer contains separate pieces of content.\nTo get a sense of how layers are constructed, let's take a look at this Layers panel.\nI've closed my other panels, so that we can focus on the Layers panel.\nBut you can skip that.\nBy the way: If your Layers panel isn't showing, go up to the Window menu and choose Layers from there.\nThe Layers panel is where you go to select and work with layers.\nIn this image there are 4 layers, each with separate content.\nIf you click the Eye icon to the left of a layer, you can toggle the visibility of that layer off and on.\nSo, I'm going to turn off the visibility of the tailor layer.\nAnd keep your eye on the image, so you can see what's on that layer.\nI'll do the same for the cloth layer and for the pattern layer.\nYou can see that the bottom layer, the Background layer, is filled with white, because this image started with a new blank image preset with a white background.\nLet's turn on all the other layers again by clicking in the empty box just to the left of each layer to add the Eye icon back in.\nNow let's take a look at just one layer, the tailor layer.\nA quick way to turn off all the layers except the tailor layer, is to hold down the Option key on the Mac, or the ALT key on the PC, and click on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer.\nIn the Document window, you can see that this layer contains just the one small photo surrounded by a gray and white checkerboard pattern.\nThat pattern represents transparent pixels, which allow us to see down through the corresponding part of this layer to the content of the layers below.\nSo, let's turn that content back on by going back to the Layers panel, again holding the Option key on the Mac or the ALT key on the PC and clicking on the Eye icon to the left of the tailor layer.\nAnd all the other layers and their Eye icons come back into view.\nSo again: You might think of layers like a stack of pints of glass, each with its own artwork and in some cases transparent areas that let you see down through to the layers below.\nThe biggest benefit of having items on separate layers like this, is that you'll be able to edit pieces of an image independently without affecting the rest of the image.\nFollow along with this example to see what I mean.\nLet's say you wanted to edit or move just the small photo of the cloth being cut.\nTo do that, you'd have to select the layer that contains that photo.\nGo to the Layers panel and click on the cloth layer just to the right of the layer name.\nNow that the cloth layer is selected, any editing you do will affect only that layer.\nFor example, go to the Tools panel and select the Move tool and then click on the cloth photo and drag - and only that photo moves, because only that layer is selected.\nAnd this applies to other kinds of edits too.\nFor example, if you painted on the image or applied a filter, as you'll do later in this tutorial series, those edits would affect only the selected cloth layer and not the rest of the image.\nBy the way: There are some editing activities, like moving layers, that you can do to more than one layer at a time.\nAnd to do that, you need to select more than one layer.\nOver in the Layers panel, we already have the cloth layer selected.\nIf you don't, click on that layer.\nTo select the tailor layer too, hold down the Command key on a Mac or the Ctrl key on a PC, and click on the tailor layer.\nWith both layers selected, you can click and drag either of those photos and they'll move together.\nNow here's a bonus tip: With the Move tool selected, take a look at its Options bar.\nAnd you'll see this option, Auto-Select: Layer is checked.\nWith that option checked, clicking anywhere in the image will automatically select the top layer at that location that contains content.\nFor example, watch the Layers panel as I click over here on the pattern photo and you'll see that the pattern layer was automatically selected for you in the Layers panel.\nSometimes that's really useful, but sometimes it can cause you to inadvertently select a layer that you didn't mean to.\nTo avoid that you can uncheck Auto-Select: Layer in the Move tool Options bar and instead select layers manually by clicking on them in the Layers panel, as we did in this tutorial.\nSo, to recap: Being able to work with selected pieces of content independently is the biggest benefit of using layers.\nThere's lots more to learn about layers, so stay tuned for the rest of this tutorial.",

        "summary": "Layers in Photoshop CC are like stacked transparent sheets, each containing separate content that can be edited independently. The Layers panel is used to select, toggle visibility, and manage these layers. Transparent areas in layers allow viewing content from layers below. Editing or moving content affects only the selected layer, enabling precise control over image elements. Multiple layers can be selected and moved together by using keyboard shortcuts. The Move tool's Auto-Select option can automatically select layers by clicking on image content, but it can be disabled to avoid accidental selections. Understanding and using layers effectively is essential for flexible and non-destructive image editing in Photoshop.",

        "page_content": "Brightness/Contrast adjustment. Let's try it out on this image from the practice files for this tutorial, or on a slightly dark, slightly dull photograph of your own. First, take a quick look at the Layers panel and make sure that you have the layer with the photograph selected. When you are working with photographs, often you'll have only one layer. Then go up to the Image menu at the top of the screen. And from there, go to the Adjustments category. We're going to try the first adjustment: Brightness/Contrast... That opens this Brightness/Contrast dialog box which I've moved over to the side, so we can see the image. The fastest way to make a change here, is to click the Auto button. That would move the Brightness and Contrast sliders here to where Photoshop CC thinks they should be. But if you want more control, you can move the sliders yourself. The Brightness slider is sometimes all you need. It controls the overall lightness or darkness of an image. For example, if I drag it to the right, notice that the photo is getting brighter. If I would go to the left, the photo would be darker. I'm going to take it to the right of where we started which was 0, brightening up the photo quite a bit. By the way, don't feel that you have to use the same values I'm using, either in this video or anywhere in this tutorial. The right amount is up to you and your taste. Sometimes, as I said, increasing or decreasing brightness is all you have to do to improve a dark or light photo. But there's another slider here too, the Contrast slider. This slider controls the range of light and dark tones in an image. If you increase contrast, I'll drag the Contrast slider way over, so you can see what it does. The dark tones in the image get darker, and the bright tones get brighter. Too much contrast like this, can make it difficult to see detail in the shadow areas, like in these flowers here or over here, and can cause a loss of detail in bright highlight areas. Like up here in the background. So that's what high contrast looks like. Let's go to the other extreme and pull this slider, all the way to the left. And now you can see what a low contrast image might look like. A little bit flat, a little bit dull. I'm going to put Contrast back where I started, at 0 by typing 0 into the value field for the Contrast slider. So, I think this image could use a little more pop. Therefore, I'm going to drag the Contrast slider just slightly to the right. And that will often do the trick. One way to help you evaluate whether your changes have really improved the image, is to see it before and after view. And you can do that by clicking the Check box next to Preview in this dialog. So, there's how the image started. And here's how it looks, with the increased brightness and contrast that we applied. When you're satisfied, click OK. And that applies your changes directly to the selected layer, in this case to the photograph. If you don't like them, you still have a chance to undo or step backwards as we learned to do earlier in this series. But just to make sure you can always get back to the original, I suggest that when you save an image you've adjusted, like this, you choose Save As... rather than Save. And give the file a different name. And then click the Save button. Now a direct Brightness/Contrast adjustment, like the one we used, is not the only way to correct exposure problems. Later in this tutorial, we'll learn how to apply an adjustment more flexibly, as a readable adjustment layer. And there are other ways to tackle exposure too. Like levels and curves adjustments, that you'll explore as you get more experienced with Photoshop CC. But the Brightness/Contrast adjustment is a relatively simple solution, that can often improve the look of your photos.",

        "page_content": "It's always amazing to see how Photoshop CC can remove a large object or sometimes even a person from an image.\nOne way to try removing a large object is by filling over it with a special fill command: Content-Aware Fill.\nLet's try it on this image, where we can remove this large wooden walkway.\nThe first step is to make a rough selection around the object you want to remove.\nWe'll use the Lasso tool, but you could use a different selection tool of your choice, keeping in mind that your selection has to include a little of the background, as you'll see.\nI'm going to click on the Lasso tool in the Tools panel and then move into the image and draw a selection outside the walkway.\nNow this is important: You have to include a small bit of the surrounding area inside the selection all the way around.\nDown at the bottom I'm going to go outside the Document window and all the way around and back to the beginning and then release my finger from the mouse or trackpad to complete the selection.\nNow comes the main step: Go up to the Edit menu and choose Fill...\nAnd in the Fill dialog box go to the Contents menu and choose Content-Aware.\nThen just click OK.\nIn just a second the walkway is gone.\nLet's deselect by going to the Select menu and choosing Deselect or using the keyboard shortcut Command + D on Mac, CTRL + D on Windows.\nWhat Photoshop CC has done is to automatically take some grass from outside of the walkway, use it to cover up the walkway, and then blend the result in with the surrounding area.\nIt really is amazing.\nNow here's a bonus tip: If you see any blurry areas where the walkway was, you can try using the Clone Stamp Tool to cover that area.\nTo do that go over to the Tools panel and select the Clone Stamp Tool.\nAnd then go up to its Options bar to the Opacity slider, click there and drag the Opacity slider to the left to lower the strength of the opacity of the Clone Stamp Tool.\nAnd then click in a blank area to close that slider.\nMove into the image and find some grass that isn't blurry.\nIf your brush tip is really small, press the right bracket key on the keyboard, which is near the P key on the keyboard, a couple of times to make the brush tip bigger.\nThen sample some of the non-blurry grass by holding down the Option key on the Mac or the ALT key on Windows, so the cursor changes to this target symbol.\nClick to sample there and then remove your finger from the Option key or the ALT key.\nNow move over the area that's a little bit blurry and click and drag to add some texture back in there.\nIf you do like the result go up to the File menu, choose Save As... and save your image in the Photoshop format.\nYou'll be surprised at how big a change you can make to an image by removing large items.\nWith only a few clicks you have a whole new image to display or to use as a background for a new design.",

The tool blends the filled area seamlessly with the background, effectively removing the unwanted object. If any blurry spots remain, the Clone Stamp Tool can be used to restore texture by sampling nearby clear areas and painting over the blur. Adjusting the Clone Stamp's opacity and brush size helps achieve a natural look. Finally, the edited image can be saved in Photoshop format. This method enables significant image changes with just a few simple steps.",

        "page_content": "When you add text to an image in Photoshop CC it automatically appears on a special kind of layer called a type layer.\nText on a type layer remains editable so that you can always change its content or its appearance.\nAnd it has smooth edges when printed, even if you make the text a lot bigger.\nIn this video we'll practice adding text to an image.\nYou can use this image from the downloadable practice files for this tutorial or an image of your own.\nThe tool you use most often to create text is the Horizontal Type tool.\nYou can select it here in the Tools panel.\nThen go up to the Options bar and click on the Font menu.\nHere you'll see a list of fonts that you can scroll through to choose one you like.\nThe list shows you a preview of what each font looks like.\nOr if you know the font that you want you can just type it here in the font field. I'll type Georgia.\nAnd Photoshop CC shows you all available styles of that font.\nI'll choose Georgia Bold.\nIf you don't have this font, choose a font of your own.\nNext let's set the font size.\nThis menu shows you the font size in points by default.\nBy the way: The default size is very small on a large image like this.\nIf you ever enter type and you can't see it, that's probably why.\nSo just try again with a larger font size.\nHere you can type in a font size if you know it or you can click this arrow and choose a font size from the drop-down menu.\nI'll choose a large font size.\nLet's use white for the text we're going to enter.\nTo set the font color go up to the Options bar and click the Font Color field.\nThat opens the Color Picker, which we covered in an earlier tutorial in this series.\nTo select white here go to the large field on the left and click on white and then click OK.\nIf you want to type uppercase letters, as I do, press the Caps lock key on your keyboard.\nThen click in the image and start typing.\nI'm going to type the name of a fictional tailor business.\nYou can type any name you like.\nAfter you enter or edit text you always have to accept it.\nOne way to do that is to go up to the Options bar and click the big Checkmark there.\nIf the text isn't where you want it, then go to the Tools panel and select the Move tool.\nClick in the image and drag the text where you want it.\nNow take a look at the Layers panel.\nYou'll see that Photoshop CC has created a new layer for you and has even named it for you.\nThe T icon on the layer indicates that this is a special re-editable type layer.\nNow let's say you want another type layer.\nUsing multiple type layers will let you work with and position each one separately, just like regular layers.\nSo let's go back to the Tools panel and select the Horizontal Type tool again.\nThen move into the image and hold down the Shift key, as you click to start a new type layer.\nThat assures that the new text will end up on its own layer rather than tacked on to the end of the first layer, which can happen if you start making one type layer too close to another.\nLet's choose some different options for this type layer.\nI'll go up to the Font menu and this time I'm going to choose a different font and a smaller font size.\nAnd then I'll start typing.\nYou can type what you like.\nAt the end of the first line I'm going to press the Return or the Enter key on the keyboard to add another line of type on the same type layer.\nWhen you're finished typing, go up to the Options bar and click the big Checkmark.\nAs long as you still have the type layer selected in the Layers panel and you still have the Horizontal Type tool selected in the Tools panel, you can change the options for this type layer.\nFor example, if I want the 2 lines of type on this layer to be center-aligned, here in the Options bar I'll click the Center Align icon.\nThen select the Move tool in the Tools panel and click on the new text and drag it where you want it.\nAnd now there's another type layer over in the Layers panel.\nWhen you're finished, go to the File menu and choose Save As... In the Save As dialog box it's important to save in the Photoshop format and to leave Layers checked in order to retain your editable type layers in this working version of the file.\nIf you need a copy to share, you can save another copy as a JPEG.\nBut the JPEG won't retain your type layers.\nSo those are the basics of creating text.\nStay tuned for the next video where we'll see how to edit text.",

The Horizontal Type tool is used to add text, allowing font, size, and color customization via the Options bar. You can type uppercase letters using Caps Lock and accept text edits by clicking the Checkmark. Multiple type layers can be created by holding Shift while typing, enabling separate positioning and styling. Text alignment and movement are adjustable using the Options bar and Move tool. The Layers panel shows each type layer with a T icon, indicating re-editable text. To preserve editable layers, save the file in Photoshop format with Layers checked. JPEG copies do not retain type layers. This tutorial covers the basics of creating and managing text layers in Photoshop.",

        "page_content": "Did you ever want to replace a blend or distracting image background?\nIn this video, we'll do just that.\nAnd we'll learn more about layer masking in the process.\nWe'll start with this photo from the practice files of an art piece by a wood artist.\nLet's replace its background with a more interesting shot from the artist studio.\nThe first step is to bring in another background image.\nTo do that go up to the File menu, choose Place Embedded..., and navigate to this image and click Place.\nGo to the Options bar and click the Checkmark.\nOver in the Layers panel, there's a brand-new layer with the new image.\nWe need to drag that new layer beneath the original Background layer.\nBut we can't do that, because the Background layer is a locked layer.\nIf you just wanted to unlock this layer, you could click this Lock icon.\nBut if you want to unlock the layer and rename it, all in one step, then select the Background layer by clicking on it, and then right click or hold down the Control key and click if you're on a Mac, and choose Layer from Background.\nAnd in the New Layer dialog box that appears, type a new name for this layer.\nI'll call it Pencil and then click OK.\nNow select the Replace_Background2 layer and click, hold and drag beneath the Pencil layer.\nYou can release your finger from the mouse or trackpad when you see a double line under the Pencil layer.\nThe next thing we're going to do, is make a selection of the background, and at that point you could delete it from the image completely, but that would be a permanent change, and wouldn't leave you very much editing flexibility.\nTo do it a more flexible way, we're going to use a selection with a layer mask.\nTo see what I mean, click on the Pencil layer in the Layers panel.\nGo over to the Tools panel.\nAnd select the Quick Selection tool.\nNow you could select either the foreground object or the background.\nSo just click and drag over the background to select it.\nBefore we apply a layer mask, we need to have the item that we want to show, not the item that we want to hide selected.\nSo, we need to invert this selection.\nGo up to the Select menu and choose Inverse.\nNow go to the Layers panel, and click the Create New Layer Mask icon at the bottom of that panel.\nThat was a real time-saver because Photoshop CC not only created a layer mask, it also filled in the area that wasn't selected on that layer mask with black.\nAnd where a layer mask is black, it hides the content on the layer to which it's attached, the Pencil layer.\nWhere a layer mask is white, it shows the content on that layer.\nOn this mask, the white is showing the pencil and the black is hiding the pencil.\nSo, we can see down through to the new background layer below.\nIf you're happy with that result, you're done.\nYou've achieved your goal of replacing the background image.\nBut here's a bonus option: You can try to fine-tune the mask to make it look even better.\nTo do that, go up to the Select menu and choose Select and Mask...\nThat opens the image with the mask applied, here in the special selected mask workspace.\nEarlier in this tutorial series, we visited this workspace when we were fine-tuning a selection.\nNow we're fine-tuning a mask which is very similar.\nFirst, let's click on the View menu and choose the way we'll view the image in this workspace.\nI'm going to choose On Layers which will let us see exactly how the pencil will look against the new background layer as we adjust the mask.\nI'll click on a blank area to close the View menu, and then I'll go to the Global Refinement section of this dialog box.\nHere there are sliders that often work well when you're trying to isolate a hard-edged image, like this pencil.\nKeep your eye on this white halo along the edge of the pencil that we want to remove, as I go to the Shift Edge slider, and I move it to the left.\nAnd what I'm doing is contracting the mask so that it's hiding that edge.\nYou also can try dragging the Smooth slider to the right, to smooth out the edge of that mask and I might try dragging the Contrast slider to the right, to make the edge along the pencil a little more contrasty or crisp.\nWhen you're done with the sliders, scroll down and make sure the Output to menu is set to Layer Mask, and then click OK.\nAnd that modifies the layer mask that we already had applied to the Pencil layer.\nOne last thing: Notice that there's a Link icon between the layer mask thumbnail and the image thumbnail on the Pencil layer.\nThat means that if we were to move the Pencil layer, the layer mask would go with it.\nGo over to the Tools panel, and get the Move tool, and then click on the pencil and drag it over to the right.\nNow all that's left to do is to save the image, and you want to be sure to use the Save As... command, and save in the Photoshop - the PSD format - so that you retain your layers and this layer mask, so that you have the flexibility to come back in in the future and fine-tune your layer mask further if you want to.",

It starts by placing a new background image beneath the original, unlocked and renamed layer. A selection of the background is made with the Quick Selection tool, then inverted to select the foreground object. A layer mask is created to hide the original background non-destructively, revealing the new background layer. The mask can be fine-tuned in the Select and Mask workspace using sliders like Shift Edge, Smooth, and Contrast to improve the edge quality. The tutorial also shows how to move the masked object while keeping the mask linked. Finally, it advises saving the file in PSD format to preserve layers and masks for future editing.",
